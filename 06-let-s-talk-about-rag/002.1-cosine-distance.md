# **Distance** between 2 vectors 📏
> eg: *distance between the user question and a chunk of text*
- Vector databases generally provide the service for calculating these distances
- Otherwise, you can use **cosine distance** to calculate the distances.
  - **Cosine distance** measures the **cosine of the angle** separating two vectors.
  - If the result is close to **`1`**, the vectors are very similar (small angle).
