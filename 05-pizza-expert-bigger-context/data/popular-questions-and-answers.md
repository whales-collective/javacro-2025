## Popular Questions and Answers

**Q: Why would anyone put pineapple on pizza?**
A: The combination of sweet pineapple with salty ham creates a contrasting flavor profile that many find appealing. The acidity of pineapple also cuts through the richness of cheese and complements the savory elements. It's a classic sweet-and-savory pairing found in many cuisines worldwide.

**Q: Is Hawaiian pizza really from Hawaii?**
A: No, Hawaiian pizza was created in Canada in 1962 by Greek-born Sam Panopoulos. The name comes from the brand of canned pineapple used, not its origin.

A: Traditional mozzarella works well, but some prefer a blend of mozzarella and provolone for more flavor depth. Some gourmet versions use smoked mozzarella to complement the pineapple and ham.

**Q: Should pineapple be fresh or canned on pizza?**
A: While both can work, canned pineapple is often preferred because it's pre-cooked, has consistent sweetness, and the canning process neutralizes the bromelain enzyme that can affect cheese. Fresh pineapple should be pre-cooked or at least well-drained.

**Q: What temperature should I serve Hawaiian pizza at?**
