Bob, a Hawaiian Pizza expert powered by Docker Model Runner [897159]
I propose to explain how to create Bob, a "digital engram with a personality" (1) specialized in Hawaiian Pizza. This will be an opportunity to:

- completely demystify the concept of generative AI,
- learn how to build generative AI applications
- do it exclusively with local LLMs (not the "big" ones)

After this presentation, you will understand what prompts, context, RAG, function calling (or tools), and MCP (Model Context Protocol) are, but you'll also know how to implement them.

For this, I will use Docker Model Runner (2) to run LLMs locally and LangchainJS for the code, with Docker Compose to orchestrate everything.

And finally, you'll have proof that AI is useful and that for specific needs, you don't need ChatGPT or Claude.AI - you can use "normal" resources.
