# Chunk and Overlap Concepts
## Splitting `ORIGINAL TEXT` into chunks `1` & `2` with **overlap** 
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ORIGINAL TEXT              │
│  "Here is a long text that needs to     │
│   be divided into multiple pieces to    │
│   be processed efficiently by a RAG     │
│   system. This text contains several    │
│   sentences and important concepts that │
│   must be preserved during              │
│   segmentation."                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
