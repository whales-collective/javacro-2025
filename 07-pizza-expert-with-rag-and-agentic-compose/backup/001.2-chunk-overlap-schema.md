# Schema: Chunk and Overlap Concepts

## Original Text
```
Here is a long text that needs to be divided into multiple pieces to be processed efficiently by a RAG system. This text contains several sentences and important concepts that must be preserved during segmentation.
```

## Chunk Division with Overlap

### Configuration: chunkSize: 512, overlap: 128

## Benefits of Overlap

### ✅ **Context Preservation**
- Important information at chunk boundaries is not lost
- Maintains semantic coherence between segments

### ✅ **Better Search**
- Increases chances of finding relevant information
- Avoids cuts in the middle of important concepts

### ✅ **Robustness**
- Compensates for automatic segmentation limitations
- Ensures complete content coverage

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chunk Size**: Maximum size of each text segment
2. **Overlap**: Overlapping zone between consecutive chunks
3. **Goal**: Preserve context and improve RAG accuracy
4. **Trade-off**: More overlap = more redundancy but better context
