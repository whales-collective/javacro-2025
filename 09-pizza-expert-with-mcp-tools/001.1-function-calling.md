# 🛠️ Function Calling / Tools support
> To use <span class="dodgerblue">**MCP**</span> you need a LLM with <span class="dodgerblue">**Tools**</span> support

It is the ability of certain models to **recognize** when a function should be called, and to **generate the necessary arguments** for that function.

> You need to provide the model with a <span class="dodgerblue">**list of functions**</span> descriptions it can call, along with their parameters and descriptions.
> 🤚🤚🤚 <span class="indianred">**SLMs are bad with function calling**</span>
